# resume-matching-system

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project provides an API-first, AI-powered resume matching system designed to automate resume screening and candidate-job relevance scoring using cutting-edge technologies. The system combines microservices architecture, Large Language Models (LLMs), and vector databases to deliver enterprise-ready resume matching for HR teams, staffing agencies, and career platforms.

It uses a modular, agent-based orchestration flow where each component performs a specialized task â€” from resume parsing, embedding generation, and job description comprehension to final matching and scoring. It supports both local and scalable deployment options including Docker and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## âœ… Features

- **Resume Upload & Parsing:** Accepts resumes in PDF/DOCX format and extracts structured content using LLMs and traditional NLP.
- **Job Description Ingestion:** Handles job creation with automatic semantic embedding generation.
- **Resume Matching:** Uses cosine similarity with FAISS on vector embeddings for intelligent scoring and ranking.
- **Agent Workflow Engine:** Orchestrates tasks through CrewAI agents.
- **API-First Design:** RESTful APIs using FastAPI with OpenAPI docs.
- **Cloud & DevOps Ready:** Built for containerization, logging, and production-grade monitoring.
